## Hi! I'm Victor! 👋

### Who I am?

My name is Victor Dominguez and I come from the shiny Spain, currently living in the capital of the country, Madrid. I consider myself as a Software Engineer in the whole meaning of the word, as I have interest in a lot of field, such as mobile development, architecture modelling, embedded software or continuous integration.

Nowadays you can find me working as an Android and Embedded Software Engineer in Custos Mobile, a small company focused on payment industry, but in the past I were involved in the automotive industry colaboring in TTTech Auto (a NXP company) and as a freelance in fields like web development. Also I studied a Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Information Society Technologies, refining them later with a Master Degree on Distributed and Embedded Software, the areas of Computer Science that I enjoy the most.

In parallel, I strongly believe on open source power, so on my profile you can find my tiny grain of sand on some projects, but I'm willing to participate more actively and also as speaker.

### 🖥️ A little bit about me...

I am not the typical geeky tech guy. Software Engineering is my main passion, but I have other strong interests like..

- 🏎 I love **motorsport**, true love since my childhood. While studying at university, I was part of [UPMRacing](https://upm-racing.es/), a Formula Student Team. Maybe you can find me on a F1 or MotoGP race, or event at the 24 hours of Le Mans!

- 📸 Since later 2023 I started to do some **photography** and I'm enjoying a lot, but I'm still a rookie. Tech 💖 Art.

- 🎤 Of course, I love **music**! I cannot live without my headphones, or without going to some concerts. Sometimes I'm brave enough to do my worst in a karaoke!

- 🏊‍♂️ I love to go to the gym and also doing some **sports**, like swimming, padel.. or even karting! As a wise man said, *Mens sana in corpore sano*.

- 🏛️ I truly belive on the **relevance of the internationality**, specially on Europe. Since my teenager years, I try to be involved in some degree on the Political and Public Affairs of my society. Due to this, I also love travel and discover new countries, cultures and people.
